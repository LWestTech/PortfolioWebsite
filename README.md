Yeah, definately a personal project right here, not much to look at right now. I'm sure i'll keep working on this some time in the near future. Hope you like what you see here, open source traveler.

Oh yeah, if you dont want to have to fish around in deployments or whatever, this website is hosted currently at a github page at:
